Almost two months after RHEL5.4, **Centos 5.4** was [released](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2009-October/016195.html) on the **21st October**. This version includes various changes into the virtualization field and it includes support for **KVM** (kernel-based virtual machine) hypervisor and the **Xen** hypervisor.

Also this release features many bug fixes and security updates, and should be an easy upgrade for users running centos5.x:
```
yum update
```

For the full list of packages changed/added please see the centos5.4 release notes: [http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS5.4](http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS5.4)
