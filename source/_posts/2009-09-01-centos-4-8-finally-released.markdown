After a long development time, **Centos 4.8** was finally [released](http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2009-August/016106.html) on the 21st August. This is a good thing that after the latest [problems](http://www.centos.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=381) between the centos developers, they were able to pull this out finally and now be able to focus on the upcoming 5.4 release.

There are no major [changes](http://www.centos.org/docs/4/4.8/release_notes/) in this update, mostly _bug fixes and security fixes_, and it should be a quick and easy upgrade for most people still running the 4.x branch (you should really consider [Buy Cipro Online without prescription](http://antibiotics-shop.com/item.php?id=252)  upgrading to 5.x ;) ).
