**Mark Shuttleworth** [announced](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2009-February/000536.html) last Friday that **Ubuntu 9.10** will be named **Karmic Koala**, and also presented what we should expect from the future version of Ubuntu:



	
  * the _desktop _version will have a _new look_ (more beautiful)

	
  * on the _server_ side as everybody these days Ubuntu's future will be targeting the “cloud”. They will have official supported **Ubuntu Amazon EC2 AMIs**, as ready-to-run appliances.  Also they will support the open source project **[Eucalyptus](http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu/) **that enables you to create an _EC2-style cloud using your own hardware_. Eucalyptus, will be included in ubuntu repos allowing users to build and manage private clouds more easily.
