If you get this error you probably compiled mencoder and mplayer without Xvid support.

To fix this error you need to re-compile mencoder and add Xvid codec support.  Please refer to this guide [**Compile Mencoder and Mplayer with Xvid and H264 Support**](http://linuxsysadminblog.com/2009/01/compile-mplayermencoder-with-xvid-and-h264-codec-support/)
