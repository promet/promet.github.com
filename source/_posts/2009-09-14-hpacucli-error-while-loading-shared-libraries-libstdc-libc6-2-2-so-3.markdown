**Problem:** I got this error when installing [**hpacucli**](http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&swItem=MTX-66b08e49c28f4bd49f4641ed80&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN) on Lenny and i can't find it on my default repo.Â  Others have similar problem.

**Solution: ** I just installed a package directly from **[packages.debian.org](http://packages.debian.org/etch/i386/libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2/download)** and this worked fine for my hpacucli in Lenny.

Any idea why this library is not included anymore?
