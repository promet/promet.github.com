Last December I gave a talk at the Chicago Drupal Meet Up on increasing your Drupal site's performance.  I thought I would share the slides from that presentation with everyone - so here it is.  I tried to cover a fairly wide array of topics at a high level.  We started with page load performance definition, identifying the differences between the high availability and scalability concepts and then we jumped into page load performance.  The talk was very drupal specific in terms of load page improvement recommendations, and we covered a few MySQL drupal performance tweaks, some apache modules and tools, such as YSLOW, Google page speed and JMeter.
