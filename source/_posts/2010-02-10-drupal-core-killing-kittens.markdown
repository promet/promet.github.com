You may know that Drupal's developers have a saying about hacking core, its whenever you hack core, god kills a kitten.

Well, whether it may or may not be true, we have learned the hard way how much can go wrong when a developer hacks core to meet some requirements and does not tell the sysadmin team about it. Â Drupal security updates are essential to the health of the site, as sysadmins, if we want to scale anything that we do, we can not manage many sites whos cores have been hacked.

If you find yourslef in the situation where you have a hacked core... you may enjoy this while you pull your hair out or wipe your tears :)
