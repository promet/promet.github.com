As I mentioned in yesterday's post, we are giving AdBard another try.  We promise we will spend all proceeds generated from the advertising for free beer for the system admins who tirelessly work to maintain the site and blog about their linux system admin experiences.

Here is the first Ad.  Click on it.  We get more beer if you do.  And its for [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/).
