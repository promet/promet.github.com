Adobe is starting to look more and more like Microsft these days. Both companies offer popular products used at home and in the enterprise, both offer multi-platform versions. Adobe does show much more love for Linux then Microsoft will likely ever will. While this isnt the [first time](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa08-01.html) PDF based exploits have been discovered, the new exploit first reported by [Security Focus](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34736/info) is a biggie mainly because it affects all platforms of Adobe Reader 8.1.4/9.1 This exploit is considered [highly critical](http://secunia.com/advisories/3492) by Secunia, a security firm.

`1. Launch Acrobat or Adobe Reader.
2. Select Edit>Preferences
