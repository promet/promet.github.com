With the **8th update** of their venerable **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4** version (_first released in February 200_5), RedHat switches to "[production 2 lifecycle phase](http://press.redhat.com/2008/07/23/support-for-red-hat-enterprise-linux-improved-through-enhanced-product-life-cycle/)", where it helps customers transition to **RHEL5**. Ideally everyone will upgrade to rhel5 by the **end of the year - Q4 200**9 (in case not done already, this is a good time to plan for this).
