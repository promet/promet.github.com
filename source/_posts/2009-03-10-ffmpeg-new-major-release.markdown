We sysadmins at promet have used ffmpeg in several of our projects and find it a great tool.  Our recent implementations include a [video distance learning](http://powerlearning21.com) tool and its also used in some of our work for sites of [members of the house of representatives](http://baird.house.gov.hillclips.tv/) using this [video platform](http://isupport.tv).
