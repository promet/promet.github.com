We will celebrate the Linux System Administrator Appriciation day tomorrow.  Yes, there is such a thing, if its in wikipedia ([wiki system administrator appreciation Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day)), than it must be true!

See what its all about here:



> **System Administrator Appreciation Day**, also known as **Sysadmin Day**, **SysAdminDay** or **SAAD**, was created by [system administrator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) Ted Kekatos. Kekatos was inspired to create the special day by a [Hewlett-Packard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard) magazine advertisement in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers.






Here is one of our own getting some appreciation from our colleagues.

So don't forget to buy your system administrator a coffee, beer, donut, or whatever he prefers, and dont ask any stupid questions tomorrow.
