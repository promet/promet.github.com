The good days of having a customized start page for **Google Apps** are over. As of December 1st 2008 Google has ceased offering the **Start Page** Service to all new Google Apps customers.  This isn't the only cut back Google has made as now only 100 **e-mail  accounts** are available with the free **Standard** version of Google Apps. I'm predicting that soon Google will make the Documents service only available to new paid customers of the Google Apps Suite.

Better stock up on those free and wonderful Google hosted services while they are still available.
