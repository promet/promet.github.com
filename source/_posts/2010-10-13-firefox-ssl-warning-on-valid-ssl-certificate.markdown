Normally, you will receive this warning when you are using a self-signed ssl certificate.  But I encountered this issue on a domain with valid ssl from Verisign.  Warning message indicates that Verisign not recognized.

**Update:**
Need to install [**GeoTrust's intermidiate CA**](https://knowledge.geotrust.com/support/knowledge-base/index?page=content&id=AR1422).
