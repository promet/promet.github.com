When I started working in systems, one of my first client was a major bank.  Yes, this was back in the mainframe batch processing days.  They never did any system updates when they ran the month end, quarter end and especially year end.

I always thought that they just weren't confident in their system folks and scoffed at this policy as it always made our deadlines shorter.

I think this story convinced me that doing production work these days on the bussiest web days is not a good idea.  Maybe microsoft should have borrowed a page from the mainframe policy manual - don't do system updates on black monday or black friday as it may cause system outage.
