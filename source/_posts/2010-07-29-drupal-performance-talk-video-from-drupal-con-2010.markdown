I have already mentioned that [google will start penalizing your site](http://linuxsysadminblog.com/2010/04/google-will-use-site-performance-and-page-load-speed-in-serp-ranking-sysadmin-seo-here-we-come/) in search if it is not fast enough.  I have recently given a presentation at Drupal Con about Drupal performance and page speed.  Below is a video of our session - its currently the fifth most watched session from the conference according to [archive.org](http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=DrupalCon%20SF%202010&sort=-downloads).  Alternatively, there are several different formats [there as well](http://www.archive.org/details/MakeDrupalRunFast-IncreasePageLoadSpeed).
