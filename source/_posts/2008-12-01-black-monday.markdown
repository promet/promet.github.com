> E-commercre Report; Several of the most popular online merchants have struggled to cope with the heavy holiday traffic, a survey shows.


Ok, that was [NYTimes 2003](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E7DA103CF936A25751C1A9659C8B63) – what about now?   This season there have already been several announcements of ecommerce snafus.  Sears.com site shut down for a couple of hours and there have even been rumors of apple.com having problems.

What is the biggest E-Shopping Day in History?  According to this Forbes article ([http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/29/cyber-monday-shopping-record-biz-cx_tvr_1129shop.html](http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/29/cyber-monday-shopping-record-biz-cx_tvr_1129shop.html))  :by tagging it as the unofficial start of the online holiday shopping season, saw a 26% gain in sales from the same day in 2005 to $608 million, according to industry tracker comScore Networks. The result, beating expectations, marked the single biggest shopping day in e-commerce history.

So what should a pragmatic system admin do about this?
