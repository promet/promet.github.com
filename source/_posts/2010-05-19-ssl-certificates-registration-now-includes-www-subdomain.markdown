Good News! :)

I recently purchased SSL certificate (GeoTrust QuickSSL Premium) for our client domain (_example.com_) and I was surprised because it also registered the "**www**" sub-domain (_www.example.com_).  Before, you need to purchase both SSL or configure your website to redirect to either **www** or **non-www**.

I am not sure if this is available on other SSL type from GeoTrust and other SSL providers.
