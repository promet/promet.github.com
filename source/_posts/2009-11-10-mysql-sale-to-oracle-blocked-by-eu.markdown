Today the EU [createded a serious road block](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703808904574526072224895160.html) on the road to the merger of Sun Microsystems and Oracle.  Here is the timeline of events up to now.

> European antitrust authorities formally objected to Oracle Corp.'s proposed purchase of Sun Microsystems Inc., complicating a $7.4 billion deal that U.S. officials had already blessed.

> The companies said Monday that the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, issued a statement of objections regarding the deal, which they said focuses on whether Oracle's takeover of Sun's MySQL database software would reduce competition in the database market.

Here is a quick recap of MySQL history, and how it got where it is today:

* [MySQL is born in 1994](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL#Product_History).
* MySQL becomes the most used and popular database used by websites.
* Sun Microsystems buys MySQL for 1.0 Billion Dollars.
* Sun hemerages money, [Oracle steps in to buy Sun/MySQL](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-04/sunflash.20090420.1.xml).

So where does this leave MySQL and hundreds of sites that depend on it?  Sun has predominantly been a hardware company.  Oracle recently introduced its software running on Sun hardware (You may have seen the ads comparing Oracle Running on Sun being x number of faster than same software running on IBM hardware).  Oracle maintains that MySQL will continue to stand alone as a open-source product.  However that may just be the problem that the EU has with it, saying that because it will be owned by Oracle, which already has a powerful commercial product, the merger will prevent MySQL from becoming another powerful database commercial competitor.  So, what do you think?  Will MySQL wilt in the shadow of the mighty Oracle?
