[RieserFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS) is a journalling filesystem that is excellent when dealing with small files under 4K in size. When used with [tail-packing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_packing) it is 10-15x faster then ext2/ext3. ReiserFS was first included in Linux kernel 2.4.1 and even used  as default filesystem in SUSE Enterprise Linux and others. What many may not know is that [Reiser killed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Reiser), LITERALLY. The man behind this filesystem has been convicted of second degree murder for killing his wife. While this isn't exactly breaking new it just goes to show you that extroverted geeks have it in them.
