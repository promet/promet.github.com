Below is my presentation from Drupal Con 2011 where Promet Source, a [Drupal Development Company](http://www.prometsource.com) based out of Chicago was a Gold sponsor.  Although none or our proposed talks got in, we did get a slot at the Main stage.  Below are the slides of my talk.  Basically we wanted to highlight that while we do focus on automation, performance and security, with Drupal the security updates must be integrated with human support to ensure that updates do not break the site.
